Deep Learning: Computer Vision, GAN and Biological-Plausibility

Project #1: Although humans intuitively understand/interpret the world in terms of discrete objects. State-of-the-art machine vision systems do not have a good representation of visual objects. In a series of recent work, we try to incorporate the knowledge of object into deep learning networks and proposed a class of models we call "object-oriented" deep networks.

https://cbmm.mit.edu/publications/object-oriented-deep-learning

https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/113002

Students are encouraged to either:

Try variants of our model (already implemented in PyTorch) on a wide range of computer vision tasks.
Implement our models with Tensorflow.
(Advanced) Accelerate our models with customized NVIDIA CUDA code
_________

Project 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We study a few projects related to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), including inverting representations and style generation.

_________

Project #3: Biologically-Plausible training of neural networks without back propagation.

Some references: Xiao W, Chen H, Liao Q, et al. Biologically-plausible learning algorithms can scale to large datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.03567, 2018. Liao Q, Leibo J Z, Poggio T. How important is weight symmetry in backpropagation? Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2016.

_________

Project #4: Deep Learning Framework/Infrastructure. We are developing a new deep learning framework that offers a greater level of flexibility and modularity for research. Students who are interested in coding/understanding neural networks from scratch can benefit from helping developing a deep learning framework. We also need a web developer for developing the website for this framework.
